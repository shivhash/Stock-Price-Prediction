# Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing and technical indicators to predict stock price trends. Leveraging moving averages and daily returns, the analysis showcases expertise in data-driven methodologies, machine learning, financial modeling, and time series analysis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and technical indicators for accurate analysis.
- Expertise in data-driven analysis, machine learning, financial modeling, and time series analysis.
- LSTM model trained on historical stock data for precise price trend forecasting.
- Achieved a lower RMSE of 4.1994, indicating high prediction accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Stock-Price-Prediction
   ```


## Usage
1. Prepare the data:
   - Load historical stock data.
   - Perform data preprocessing including handling missing values and scaling.
   - Calculate technical indicators like moving averages and daily returns.

2. Train the LSTM model:
   - Configure the LSTM model architecture.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed data.
   - Evaluate the model performance.

3. Make predictions:
   - Use the trained model to forecast future stock prices.
   - Analyze the prediction results and plot the forecasted trends.

## Results
The LSTM model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 4.1994 on the test data, demonstrating high prediction accuracy for stock price trends.
